        <h1>About.</h1>
        <p>
          I am a third-year BTech student with a great interest in programming,
          development, machine learning, and Web3! I know Python, C, C++,
          JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Java. I am learning and developing projects
          for the Backend, Ai, ML, CV and am willing to discover more skills. I
          am also interested in research work and have written a paper named "A
          comparative Analysis of Machine Learning algorithms for Handwritten
          Digit Recognition" that has been accepted in the IEEE 3rd
          International Conference on TESMET 2023 and is yet to be published.
          With decent communication, leadership, and teamwork skills, I am
          inclined to pursue as many opportunities as possible! I learn from the
          people near me and endeavor to enhance my skills with every chance
          that comes my way.

            I made a React Weather App using the OpenWeatherMap API and GeoDB
            API with places autocomplete. This App can show you the weather of
            any city around the world, and the weather forecast for the upcoming
            seven days. You can view the features like Feels like temperature,
            Wind Speed, Humidity, Pressure, and Clouds Percentage of the current
            date, and the upcoming seven days.
